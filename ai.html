		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Arab-Israeli conflict, which has been going on for more than 60 years, began after the state of Israel gained its independence. At the root of the conflict, is a struggle for self governance and land rights; the Arabs believe the land belongs to them and that they should therefore have the right to govern themselves, whereas the Israelis believe that they deserve the land and its rights. Over the years, the conflict has worsened as both Palestinian and Israeli leadership continue to intervene, in hopes to come to an agreement. Although the majority of Palestinians and Israelis believe in the peace process, small extremist groups such as the democratically elected Hamas who deny the right of Israel to exist and the Israeli settlers who occupy Palestinian land and believe they should not be forced to leave refuse to compromise. With the likelihood of any successful peace talks happening soon deteriorating, the Arab-Israeli conflict has grabbed the attention of many and is by far one of the most relevant, controversial topics of our time, as we continue to strive for peace in the Middle East.
