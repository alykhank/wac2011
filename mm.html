	<div id="message">
		<img src="images/mm.jpg" alt="Technology &amp; Mass Media" class="image" />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last few decades, the world has moved into a technological age. Technology is used by all of us, every day in some form or another, to help us function and advance our lives. But is too much technology a bad thing? It is undeniable that technology has vastly improved the ways in which we live our lives — making our daily activities run faster and more efficiently. However, have we become so dependent on technology that we cannot run our lives without it?
		<br><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undeniably, technology has created a culture that is almost dependent on it, but has in other ways has contributed vastly to human affairs. However, have we created a “global culture” of technology? The idea of a global culture is the way in which through globalization, economies and societies have become inter-connected through a global network of communication, transportation and trade. Through new technologies, such as the Internet, it has become harder and harder to stop cultures from bleeding into one another. However, we must ask ourselves these questions: Is a “global culture” such a good thing? Has technology created a positive or negative “global culture”? Is “global culture” a culture at all?
