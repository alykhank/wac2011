		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do countries choose to intervene? When do nations decide to interfere in other nations’ foreign policies? Is intervention always done with good intentions? Do the recipient countries always accept the interference?
		<br><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To some, intervention is a means by which national security and domestic stability can be attained. To others, intervention is an act of control with the perpetrator bringing suffering and instability to the fragile nations of the world. Recent intervention under the banner of “war on terror” has destabilized the international community further and pitted the East versus the West, the Global North versus the Global South.
		<br><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, controversy abounds and emotions run high when interventionism is being discussed. Featuring David Frum (former speechwriter to George Bush), Cheri DiNovo (MPP and outspoken political activist) and John McGarry (author of numerous books on ethnic conflict and the politics of Northern Ireland) the Morning Panel is sure to divide the crowd in ways few other debates can.
		<br><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is: what’s your opinion?

		<br><br><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David Frum is the author of six books, including most recently "COMEBACK: Conservatism That Can Win Again." He is a columnist for Canada's National Post and Italy's Il Foglio and a regular contributor to American Public Media's Marketplace. From 2001 to 2002, Frum served as special assistant and speechwriter to President Bush. In 2005, he formed and led the group Americans for Better Justice, which spearheaded the opposition to the nomination of Harriet Miers to the U.S. Supreme Court. In 2007 and 2008, he was a senior policy adviser to the Rudy Giuliani presidential campaign. He is a member of the board of directors of the Republican Jewish Coalition.
