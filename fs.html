		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term “Failed State” is used to describe a country perceived to have failed to meet some of the fundamental responsibilities of a sovereign nation and is characterized by social, political and economic failure. With African countries such as Somalia, Chad and Sudan leading the pack, the number of failed states has increased drastically over that past decade. The mere labelling of a country as a failed state has become highly controversial as their alleged threat to world peace is becoming an increasingly magnified issue on the global stage. President J. Carter claimed they “are breeding grounds for, money laundering, mass refugee flows and illegal immigration” as well as international terrorism, and other international catastrophes. But who is responsible for finding solutions to these catastrophes? While the few contrarians often base their arguments on the fact that many of the acts of terrorism, while they may be planned in failed states, rely mainly on the resources of developed countries, and that money laundering and other crimes of fraud are much more prevalent in countries with more economic stability. Some even claim that the term itself, “Failed State”, is an incoherent political construct that only leads to misguided policy making. Failed states are an international dilemma and one must ask, what, if anything, can be done about them, and who is responsible for doing it?

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though I teach courses in international relations and the politics of developing areas (specifically Africa), my research interests have focused largely on problems and prospects for conflict and conflict resolution in African states. My earlier research concerned the difficulties in negotiating and implementing power-sharing agreements in the aftermath of civil wars. More recently, I have been considering the opposite approach, the possibility that secession or, more radically, the redrawing of Africa’s borders, might provide an alternative to conflict resolution. Both of these issues have been informed by an approach to politics which borrows from political realism. My most recent publication, an edited book, is a collection of papers which considers the emergence of political entities in different parts of the world which have many of the attributes of statehood but do not yet enjoy recognition from the international community. They are in effect ‘states-within-states’.
		<br><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am currently working on a project which integrates these themes of political realism, power-sharing, and secession. I am considering recent civil wars in three African states &mdash; Angola, Ethiopia, and Somalia &mdash; and the way in which rebel movements and governments consider one or more strategies of integration, secession, or domination as means for dealing with insecurity in the midst of state collapse and anarchy.
